### How to put your full source code on GitHub:

To share your project on GitHub for review, suggestions, and debugging, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd calculator2_new
    ```

2.  **Initialize a Git repository:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

3.  **Create a `.gitignore` file:** This is crucial to prevent unnecessary build files and temporary artifacts from being uploaded to your repository. Create a file named `.gitignore` in your `calculator2_new` directory with the following content:
    ```
    # Build artifacts
    *.o
    *.obj
    *.moc
    *.pro.user
    Makefile
    calculator2 # Your executable name
    debug/
    release/
    build/
    *.user
    *.bak
    *.pro.user.*
    *.qmlproject.user
    
    # Qt specific
    moc_*.cpp
    ui_*.h
    qrc_*.cpp
    
    # IDE specific
    .vscode/
    .idea/
    
    # OS generated files
    .DS_Store
    Thumbs.db
    
    # Logs and temporary files
    *.log
    *.tmp
    ```

4.  **Add all project files to the staging area:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

5.  **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit of calculator prototype"
    ```

6.  **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
    *   Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and log in.
    *   Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
    *   Give your repository a name (e.g., `QtCalculator`).
    *   **Do NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license". You've already done this locally.
    *   Click "Create repository".

7.  **Link your local repository to GitHub:**
    GitHub will provide you with commands to push an existing local repository. They will look something like this (replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>` with your actual details):
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    (If your default branch is `master`, use `git branch -M master` and `git push -u origin master` instead).

Your full source code will then be available on GitHub.

### How to package your first prototype into an app:

#### For Desktop Applications (Linux or Windows):

Your current project is a Qt C++ application, which is well-suited for desktop deployment.

**1. Build in Release Mode:**
It's important to build your application in release mode for deployment. This optimizes the code and removes debugging information.
*   Open your `calculator.pro` file. Ensure you have `CONFIG += release` (or remove `CONFIG += debug` if present).
*   Run `qmake` and then `make` in your `calculator2_new` directory:
    ```bash
    cd calculator2_new
    qmake
    make
    ```
    This will create a release executable (e.g., `calculator2` on Linux, `calculator2.exe` on Windows).

**2. Collect Dependencies (Deployment):**

*   **For Windows:**
    Qt provides a tool called `windeployqt.exe`. This tool collects all the necessary Qt DLLs, plugins, and other dependencies your application needs to run on a target machine without a Qt installation.
    1.  Open the **Qt command prompt** (e.g., "Qt 5.15.2 (MSVC 2019 64-bit)" from your Start Menu).
    2.  Navigate to your `calculator2_new` directory.
    3.  Run:
        ```bash
        windeployqt.exe calculator2.exe
        ```
    This will copy all required files into your `calculator2_new` directory, making it self-contained.

*   **For Linux:**
    Deployment on Linux often involves collecting shared libraries. `linuxdeployqt` is a popular tool for this, similar to `windeployqt`.
    1.  Download `linuxdeployqt` from its GitHub releases page.
    2.  Make it executable: `chmod +x linuxdeployqt`
    3.  Run it on your executable:
        ```bash
        ./linuxdeployqt calculator2
        ```
    This tool can also generate an AppImage, which is a universal Linux package. Alternatively, you can manually identify dependencies using `ldd ./calculator2` and copy them, or create a `.deb` or `.rpm` package.

**3. Create an Installer (Optional but Recommended):**
For a professional distribution, you might want to create an installer.
*   **Windows:** NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) or Inno Setup are popular free options.
*   **Linux:** You can create `.deb` (for Debian/Ubuntu) or `.rpm` (for Fedora/RHEL) packages, or use AppImage generated by `linuxdeployqt`.

#### For Android (APK - General Overview):

Packaging for Android is more complex and requires a specific setup:

1.  **Install Android SDK & NDK:** You'll need to install the Android SDK and NDK (Native Development Kit) through Android Studio or by downloading them separately.
2.  **Qt for Android:** Ensure you have a Qt version installed that includes Android support (e.g., `android_arm64_v8a` or `android_armv7`).
3.  **Configure Qt Creator:** In Qt Creator, go to `Tools > Options > Devices > Android` and configure your Android SDK, NDK, and Java Development Kit (JDK) paths.
4.  **Build for Android:**
    *   Open your project in Qt Creator.
    *   Add an Android Kit (e.g., "Android for armeabi-v7a" or "Android for arm64-v8a") to your project.
    *   Select the Android Kit and build your project in release mode. Qt Creator will use Gradle to build the APK.
5.  **Sign the APK:** For distribution, you'll need to sign your APK with a release key. Qt Creator can help with this, or you can use Android Studio/command-line tools.

This is a high-level overview. Each step for Android deployment can involve significant configuration. Given your current focus, desktop deployment is a more straightforward next step.
